The plan is for this to be a place to put musings, examples, and small texts relating to statistics and R/RStudio.

# Who am I?

I am Assistant Professor of Data Science at the Department of Mathematics at CUNY College of Staten Island. I am also a rampant computer geek who has been programming for fun since age 11. I use R and RStudio in my teaching, and always look for more interesting things that can be done on this platform - such as, for instance, this blog produced with the `distill` package.
